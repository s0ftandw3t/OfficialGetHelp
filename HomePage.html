				Feeling down, lonely, or even depressed? Chances are, if you're a teen, you're most likely to be experiencing
				one of these emotions. According to recent statistics, global youth suicide rates are increasing rapidly, and
				not to mention the countless cases of kids who are struggling with mental health issues. So for these reasons and more,
				this is exactly why we created <b>Get<font color="#54B948">Help</font></b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Get<font color="#54B948">Help</font></b> is an advocacy that aims to make use of Information and Communications Technology to
				provide more accessible treatment for mental health issues, especially among teens, who make use of ICT everyday.</p>
