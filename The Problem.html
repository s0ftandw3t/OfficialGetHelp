				In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on a person's mental health, as it is now acknowledged as a serious problem.
				According to a survey, 32% of teens have experience some sort of anxiety disorder, and the number of adolescents who have experienced 
				a major depressive episode was higher in 2016 than in any year in previous decades.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, a lot of these cases are unaddressed due to the ignorance regarding mental health, as well as a lack of accessibility to services
				that treat these problems. You would not expect a teen with anxiety to just go and open up about their problems. This could be due to having
				deal with talking to someone in person, or just simply not having the time to go to a therapist.
