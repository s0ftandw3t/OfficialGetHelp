			  As stated in our mission, advocacy aims to use ICT to give more accessible mental health treatment to teens. In this generation, many teens most likely just stay at home after school, and communicate with their friends, colleagues, and the outside world through ICT such as instant messaging and social media. It is quick, efficient, and does not require face-to-face interaction. There is also a degree of anonymity to it, giving you freedom to say how you feel without the fear of being judged. 
				<br><br>
				We want to take advantage of this feeling, letting teens open up about their insecurities and problems, but this time to trained professionals who know how to guide them and properly treat them. Using ICT will allow teens to remove the anxiety of have to open up to an actual person, but still to a trained professional, using a quick and non time-consuming system that can be accessed at nearly any time and place.
